Quick little snippets of code


I'm gonna be filling this repository with solutions to leetcode problems, mostly to up my github activity. 
I want to try and regularly put something in here. Maybe not every day, but close to it.

Translations of problems to other languages would probably also be a good addition, just for completeness sake. 

By the way, I'm not spending all day on these. This is just little 1 hour practice sessions in the evenings when I have time.
